Python Code Challenges:
Control Flow

1. Large Power:
    - Define the function to accept two input parameters called base and exponent
    - Calculate the result of base to the power of exponent
    - Use an if statement to test if the result is greater than 5000. If it is then return True. Otherwise, return False

2. Over Budget:
    - Define the function to accept five parameters starting with budget then food_bill, electricity_bill, internet_bill, and rent
    - Calculate the sum of the last four parameters
    - Use if and else statements to test if the budget is less than the sum of the calculated sum from the previous step.
    - If the condition is true, return True otherwise return False

3. Twice as Large:
    - Define our function with two inputs num1 and num2
    - Multiply the second input by 2
    - Use an if statement to compare the result of the last calculation with the first input
    - If num1 is greater then return True otherwise return False

4. Divisible By Ten:
    - Define the function header to accept one input num
    - Calculate the remainder of the input divided by 10 (use modulus)
    - Use an if statement to check if the remainder was 0. If the remainder was 0, return True, otherwise, return False

5. Not Sum To Ten:
    - Define the function to accept two parameters, num1 and num2
    - Add the two parameters together
    - Test if the result is not equal to 10
    - If the sum is not equal, return True, otherwise, return False
